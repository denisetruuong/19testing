# Tech Quiz Test Suite

## Overview

This assignment emphasizes the critical role of ensuring reliability and robustness in modern web applications through comprehensive testing. In today’s dynamic development environment, testing is not just an afterthought, but a key part of the development process. It ensures that applications meet user demands and perform efficiently under various conditions.

### Application Overview

In this challenge, you will enhance the starter codebase of a fully functioning **Tech Quiz** application by adding Cypress for both component and end-to-end tests. The application is built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and allows users to take a quiz with ten random questions and view their final score. Your goal is to improve the testing coverage of the application.

## Assignment Objectives

### 1. Install Cypress
Install Cypress as a dev dependency in the application to enable testing.

### 2. Configure Cypress
Set up Cypress for both **component tests** and **end-to-end tests**.

### 3. Create Tests
- Create a **component test** for the Quiz component.
- Create an **end-to-end test** for the entire quiz flow.

## User Story

**As an aspiring developer,**  
**I want to take a tech quiz**  
**so that I can test my knowledge and improve my skills.**

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Start the quiz**: When a user clicks the start button, the quiz should begin and present a question.
- **Answer questions**: After answering a question, the user should be presented with the next one.
- **End of quiz**: Once all questions are answered, the quiz should be over, and the user should be able to see their score.
- **Restart the quiz**: The user should have the option to start a new quiz.

### Mock-Up

A GIF demonstrating the functioning of the quiz application is available to show how the app works.

## Getting Started

This assignment will require you to work with a pre-built application. The **Tech Quiz** app already has a fully functioning user interface, which you will test using **Cypress**.

### Important Notes:

- **Download Starter Code**: Make sure to download the starter code files and create your own GitHub repository with the code.
- **Video Submission**: A walkthrough video is required to demonstrate the tests running successfully. Refer to the Full-Stack Blog video submission guide for instructions.
